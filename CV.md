Third-year BSc Psychology student currently working on a multi-study paper on the modern-day 
courtship of young adults to establish a baseline of typical courting behaviour and relationship related 
anxiety. I have worked on several projects across several psychological fields, including forensic 
psychology, social psychology, behavioural economics, neuropsychology, developmental psychology, 
cognitive psychology and health psychology. In my work I always strive to have a balance of research 
and applied psychology components, which is why most of my research aims to be directly applicable 
to clinical and non-clinical populations.
