I spent 5 months working in the [Behavioral and Social Neuroscience research group](https://www.ceitec.eu/behavioural-and-social-neuroscience-milan-brazdil/rg32/publication) of [Milan Brazdil](https://www.ceitec.eu/prof-milan-brazdil-ph-d/u17040) under the supervision of [Lenka Jurkovicova](https://www.ceitec.eu/lenka-jurkovicova/u91788). During my internship I worked on an international COST Project „Memory and Cognition“, which included two measurements of healthy participants from the general population. In the neuroscience part of the measurements, we collected fMRI scans, DNA samples, EEG scan in a resting mode as well as performing a Pattern Glare task while EEG and Eye Tracking was recorded. In the second behavioral part of the measurements, I administered a battery of cognitive and memory tasks the participants completed in a lab on a computer as well as the intelligence measurement WAIS-III. I gained experience with administering and scoring WAIS-III, working with EEG, Eye Tracking and MRI with a technician.

### [Childrens’ Psychiatric Hospital Louny](https://www.detska-psychiatricka-nemocnice-louny.cz/)

I had the opportunity to work with psychologists and psychiatrists at the boys’ and girls’ wards. I conducted several interviews for diagnostic purposes of patients with depression, anxiety disorders, various eating disorders or anger management issues. I gained experience with diagnostics of mental health illnesses with children, namely administering and scoring the WISC-III - Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children, WAIS-III - Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, PSSI - Persönlichkeits-Stil- und Störungs-Inventar – known in English as PSDI - Personality style and disorder inventory, CDI – The Children Depression Inventory and gaining knowledge with administering ADOS (Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule).

Apart from diagnostics, I shadowed several psychotherapeutic interviews, took active part in morning rounds and big rounds as well as morning and noon briefings where patients and treatment plans were discussed. I was part of a parent – patient – treating staff mediation meeting, during which treatment, release and future outlook of a patient was discussed with the parents and social services. Throughout the internship I gained more experience working with mentally ill children and their surroundings, I learned a lot about working in a psychiatric ward and how to deal with the stress and emotional impact working in this environment has.

In the summer of 2020, I undertook an internship under [Dr. Ondrej Timco](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ondrej-timco-63330878/?originalSubdomain=cz) at the Institute H21, an NGO that focuses on alternative voting systems such as the 2 + 1 voting method that aims to show controversial voting option. During the course of my internship I developed an app to aid high school graduates with the organization, budgeting, promotion and fundraising for their graduation prom ball. I also worked on several projects within the participatory budgeting section of the NGO. I worked on school participatory budgeting and urban development planning projects where I learned a lot about project development, management and working in small teams. I ended the internship helping with the organization of the annual symposium that is organized with the Czech Senate.

Active participation in the implementation of experimental studies in the laboratory: administration of the experiment "Research of daily activities, decision-making and reasoning" in cooperation with the Centre for Environmental Issues of the UK - interaction with participants, keeping individual deadlines, issuing rewards for participants. Involvement in the laboratory's scientific research activities: participation in the upcoming review study on euthanasia attitudes. During my years I worked closely mainly with [Nikola Frollova](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nikola-frollova-9b581ba2/) with whom I am currently preparring a paper for a peer reviewed journal.

IKSP is a research organization under the Czech Ministry of Justice at which I undertook an internship in 2018 recoding news about criminal activity in the past 20 years. The research project lead by Lucie Hakova focused on how criminal activities are presented in the media to see if there is a typical narrative in the news about certain type of criminal activity. I was responsible for manually coding the news articles into a form that was then used for the analysis.

Summer Academy for highschool students mainly from the Czech and Slovak Republics. I have been a student at the academy in years 2016 and 2017. Since then I have been working within the academy executive structure working on many aspects of the curriculum, including work in small teams focusing on mental health of our students, career workshops or psychological talks and workshops.
