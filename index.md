## About

I am a third-year BSc Psychology student at the University of Lincoln currently working on a multistudy paper under the supervision of Dr Ross Bartels and Dr Mark Gresswell. For the past two years, my research focus has been on the modern-day courtship of young adults to establish a baseline of typical courting behaviours of adults aged 18 - 25 years.

Dating has evolved due to the influence of social media and technology advancements to become faster and more user-friendly to suit the needs of the modern age lifestyle. I believe there will be a shift in what typical courtship looks like now, which should redefine several atypical courting behaviours like stalking, abusive domestic tendencies or controlling behaviours.

I have worked on several projects across several psychological fields, including forensic psychology, social psychology, behavioural economics, neuropsychology, developmental psychology, cognitive psychology and health psychology. Out of my experiences, the most influencing has been my internship at the Childrens' Psychiatric Hospital Louny in my motherland the Czech Republic, along with my internship at CEITEC and volunteering and teaching at Summer Academy Discover.

In my work I always strive to have a balance of research and applied psychology, which is why I aim to have most of my research directly applicable to clinical or non-clinical populations. My long-term goal is to design research and teach while working with a clinical population in an applied setting.

## Experience

### CEITEC – Central European Institute of Technology

I spent 5 months working in the Behavioral and Social Neuroscience research group of Milan Brazdil under the supervision of Lenka Jurkovicova. During my internship I worked on an international COST Project „Memory and Cognition“, which included two measurements of healthy participants from the general population. In the neuroscience part of the measurements, we collected fMRI scans, DNA samples, EEG scan in a resting mode as well as performing a Pattern Glare task while EEG and Eye Tracking was recorded. In the second behavioral part of the measurements, I administered a battery of cognitive and memory tasks the participants completed in a lab on a computer as well as the intelligence measurement WAIS-III. I gained experience with administering and scoring WAIS-III, working with EEG, Eye Tracking and MRI with a technician.

### Childrens’ Psychiatric Hospital Louny

I had the opportunity to work with psychologists and psychiatrists at the boys’ and girls’ wards. I conducted several interviews for diagnostic purposes of patients with depression, anxiety disorders, various eating disorders or anger management issues. I gained experience with diagnostics of mental health illnesses with children, namely administering and scoring the WISC-III - Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children, WAIS-III - Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, PSSI - Persönlichkeits-Stil- und Störungs-Inventar – known in English as PSDI - Personality style and disorder inventory, CDI – The Children Depression Inventory and gaining knowledge with administering ADOS (Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule).

Apart from diagnostics, I shadowed several psychotherapeutic interviews, took active part in morning rounds and big rounds as well as morning and noon briefings where patients and treatment plans were discussed. I was part of a parent – patient – treating staff mediation meeting, during which treatment, release and future outlook of a patient was discussed with the parents and social services. Throughout the internship I gained more experience working with mentally ill children and their surroundings, I learned a lot about working in a psychiatric ward and how to deal with the stress and emotional impact working in this environment has.

### H21

In the summer of 2020, I undertook an internship under Dr. Ondrej Timco at the Institute H21, an NGO that focuses on alternative voting systems such as the 2 + 1 voting method that aims to show controversial voting option. During the course of my internship I developed an app to aid high school graduates with the organization, budgeting, promotion and fundraising for their graduation prom ball. I also worked on several projects within the participatory budgeting section of the NGO. I worked on school participatory budgeting and urban development planning projects where I learned a lot about project development, management and working in small teams. I ended the internship helping with the organization of the annual symposium that is organized with the Czech Senate.

### PLESS – Prague Laboratoy

Active participation in the implementation of experimental studies in the laboratory: administration of the experiment "Research of daily activities, decision-making and reasoning" in cooperation with the Centre for Environmental Issues of the UK - interaction with participants, keeping individual deadlines, issuing rewards for participants. Involvement in the laboratory's scientific research activities: participation in the upcoming review study on euthanasia attitudes.

### IKSP – Institute of Criminology and Social Prevention

IKSP is a research organization under the Czech Ministry of Justice at which I undertook an internship in 2018 recoding news about criminal activity in the past 20 years. The research project lead by Lucie Hakova focused on how criminal activities are presented in the media to see if there is a typical narrative in the news about certain type of criminal activity. I was responsible for manually coding the news articles into a form that was then used for the analysis.

### Discover – Summer Academy Discover
